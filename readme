Mini Audit Trail Generator

This is a small full-stack project I made for practise / intern task.
Main idea is: user writes some text, and everytime they click Save Version, the app will store that version and show what words where added or removed from last version.
Its like a mini “version history” but very simple one.

Tech used
React (frontend)
Node + Express (backend)
Axios for calling API
Tailwind for doing quick UI
UUID for making unique id

How it works
User types something in the textarea
When they press Save Version, frontend sends:
previousText (last saved one)
newText (current one)
Backend compares both and finds:
added words
removed words
It saves every version in a array (in memory only)
Version History panel shows all the saved versions

How to run
Backend
cd backend
npm install
node server.js

Server runs on: http://localhost:4000

Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

Runs on: http://localhost:3000

Features
Show added / removed words
Show timestamp
Shows old and new lenght
Simple UI (just for demo)

No database, data gone if server restart (its ok for this task)
